"""Lazy settings wrapper for django_admin_react.

All package settings live under a single optional dict
``settings.DJANGO_ADMIN_REACT``. Defaults are applied lazily so that
adding the app to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` does not require a settings entry.

Usage in package code:

    from django_admin_react.conf import settings
    settings.MAX_PAGE_SIZE

Nothing in the package should read ``django.conf.settings.DJANGO_ADMIN_REACT``
directly — go through this module so defaults are consistent.

    # no React rebuild. Must be a hex color (``#rgb`` / ``#rgba`` /
    # ``#rrggbb`` / ``#rrggbbaa``); anything else is rejected at render and
    # falls back to ``DEFAULT_PRIMARY_COLOR`` below, since the value is
    # written into a ``<style>`` block and must not be able to inject CSS.
    #
    # ``None`` (default) means "consumer didn't explicitly set this" — the
    # SPA reads ``site_primary_color`` off the configured ``AdminSite``
    # next, then falls back to ``DEFAULT_PRIMARY_COLOR``. Mirrors
    # ``BRAND_TITLE`` / ``BRAND_LOGO_URL``: setting wins as the

    # anonymous users (with the CSRF cookie set) and the in-SPA login
    # form POSTs to the API package's ``/api/v1/login/``. A consumer
    # who wants the legacy HTML-admin login back can opt out with

    # endpoint is still mounted in either mode. The auth *mechanism* is
    # unchanged in both modes (Django's ``authenticate``/``login``
    # behind the JSON endpoint); only the UI surface differs. The
    # shell carries no user data — serving it to anonymous users
    # discloses nothing the static bundle wouldn't, and every data API
    # call still returns 403 until the user authenticates.

    #                      ``"Django admin"``.

    # ``PWA_ICONS``      — list of ``{src, sizes, type[, purpose]}``

    # are unaffected. Override when the consumer mounts
    # ``django_admin_rest_api.urls`` separately and the SPA should talk
    # to **that** mount instead — for example
    # ``DJANGO_ADMIN_REACT = {"API_URL_PREFIX": "/api/api/v1/"}`` lets
    # the SPA and any other client share a single REST mount. When set,
    # `django_admin_react.urls` skips the inline `api/v1/` include so
    # there is no double-mount.
    "API_URL_PREFIX": None,
    # ``LEGACY_ADMIN_URL_PREFIX`` — opt-in escape-hatch banner (#577).
    # When set, every SPA page renders a thin notice banner at the top
    # linking to **the same page** under the legacy Django admin's URL
    # prefix. Useful during a progressive migration: end-users with
    # muscle memory for ``/admin/`` (or wherever the legacy admin is
    # mounted) can return to the classic surface in one click, and the
    # bug list grows from "what they clicked back for." Default
    # ``None`` keeps behaviour unchanged — no banner, no extra
    # requests, no SPA overhead.
    #
    # The value matches the prefix the consumer registered the legacy
    # admin under in ``urls.py`` — e.g. ``"admin/"`` for
    # ``urlpatterns = [path("admin/", legacy_admin.urls), ...]``. The
    # SPA computes the matching legacy URL by swapping its own mount
    # for this value (both admins use the same ``app_label/model_name``
    # URL shape, so it's a straight prefix swap with no per-route
    # mapping). When the matching legacy route doesn't exist, the
    # legacy admin 404s — same outcome as visiting that URL directly.

    # mirror strip at the top of every page linking the same path under
    # the React admin's mount — so a user on either surface can swap
    # to the other in one click. The value is the prefix the SPA was
    # mounted at in ``urls.py`` — e.g. ``"admin2/"`` for
    # ``urlpatterns = [path("admin2/", include("django_admin_react.urls")), ...]``.
    # When only ``LEGACY_ADMIN_URL_PREFIX`` is set, only the SPA-side
