"""SPA entry point view.

Serves the built React single-page app to authenticated staff. The
SPA's bundled assets ship with the package under
``django_admin_react/static/admin_react/`` and a Django template at
``django_admin_react/templates/admin_react/index.html`` references
them via a Vite-emitted manifest.

The view's only jobs are:

1. Enforce the same authentication gate as the rest of the package
   (active + staff, or whatever ``AdminSite.has_permission`` says).
2. Render ``index.html`` with the resolved mount point and the
   bundle filenames from the Vite manifest so the SPA can construct
   API URLs without hardcoding (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.5).

This view never returns 404 for "no manifest yet" — a consumer
who installed the wheel always has a manifest. In development the
helper :func:`_load_manifest` returns ``None`` and the template
falls back to a friendly "the SPA is not built; run pnpm build:vite"
message, so a contributor running ``runserver`` without having built
the frontend gets a clear next step instead of a JS error.
